Express + Webpack Homework
We've seen a lot today! Tonight's homework is going to practice everything we have seen.

Based on the starter code:

Server API Tasks
Create an api for the films app using an /api/films restful route pattern and Express Router
Index route to show all films
Get film by id (id is just an array index for now, until we hook up a database)
Create film
Update film
Delete film
Don't forget to get your app to use the controllers/index.js!
